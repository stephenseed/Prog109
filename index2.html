    <p>This Christmas cake is made with dried fruits and candied citrus 
      peel soaked in brandy to add flavor and make a rich, 
      moist fruitcake that's very popular at Christmas. 
      Delicious as-is or cover it with almond paste and 
      royal icing for a more festive touch. 
      I remember my mother storing her fruitcake in an old butter churn that
      belonged to my grandmother and great-grandmother...
      I wish I still had that old crock!</p>
